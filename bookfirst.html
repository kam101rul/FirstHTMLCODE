Wives always try to cure husbands of<br/><br/>
bad habits, even on lonely asteroids!<br/><br/>

<hr style="width: 50%">



<p>You must understand that Palmer loved his wife as much as ever, or he would never have thought <br/> of his simple little scheme at all. It was entirely for her own good, as he had told himself a dozen<br/> times in the past day. And with that he stilled whatever qualms of conscience he might otherwise<br/> have had. He didn't think of himself as being something of a murderer.<p/>><br/><br/>

She was sitting at the artificial fireplace, a cheerful relic of ancient days, reading just as peacefully<br/> as if she had been back home on Mars, instead of on this desolate outpost of space. She had <br/> adjusted quickly to the loneliness and the strangeness of this life—to the absence of friends, the<br/> need for conserving air, the strange feeling of an artificial gravity that varied slightly at the whim<br/> of impurities in the station fuel. To everything, in fact, but her husband.<br/><br/>

She seemed to sense his eyes on her, for she looked up and smiled. "Feeling all right, dear?" she<br/> asked.<br/><br/>

"Naturally. How about you?"<br/><br/>

"As well as can be expected."<br/><br/>

"Not very good, then."<br/><br/>

She didn't reply, and he thought, She hates to admit it, but she really envies me. Well, I'll fix it so <br/>that she needn't any more. And he stared through the thick, transparent metal window at the<br/> beauty of the stars, their light undimmed by dust or atmosphere.<br/><br/>

The stories told about the wretchedness of the lighthouse keepers who lived on asteroids didn't<br/> apply at all to this particular bit of cosmic rock. Life here had been wonderful, incredibly <br/>satisfying. At least it had been that way for him. And now it would be the same way for his wife as <br/>well.<br/><br/>

He would have denied it hotly if you had accused him of finding her repulsive. But to certain<br/> drunks, the sober man or woman is an offense, and Palmer was much more than a drunk. He was a <br/>marak addict, and in the eyes of the marak fiends, all things and all people were wonderful, except<br/> those who did not share their taste for the drug. The latter were miserable, depraved creatures,<br/> practically subhuman.<br/><br/>

Of course that was not the way most of them put it. Certainly it was not the way Palmer did.<br/> He regarded his wife, he told himself, as an unfortunate individual whom he loved very much, one<br/> whom it was his duty to make happy. That her new-found happiness would also hasten her death<br/> was merely an unfortunate coincidence. She was sure to die anyway, before long, so why not have<br/> her live out her last days in the peace and contentment that only marak could bring?<br/><br/>

Louise herself would have had an answer to that, if he had ever put the question to her. He was<br/> careful never to do so.<br/><br/>

She laid the book aside and looked up at him again. She said, "Jim, darling, do you think you <br/>could get the television set working again?"<br/><br/>

"Not without a mesotron rectifier."<br/><br/>

"Even the radio would be a comfort."<br/><br/>

"It wouldn't do any good, any way. Too much static from both Mars and Earth this time of year."<br/><br/>

That was the beauty of the marak, he thought. It changed his mood, and left him calm and in full <br/>command of his faculties, able to handle any problem that came up. He himself, of course, missed<br/> neither the radio nor the television, and he never touched the fine library of micro-books. He didn't<br/> need them.<br/><br/>

A shadow flitted by outside the thick window, blotting out for a moment the blaze of stars. It was <br/>the shadow of death, as he knew, and he was able to smile even at that. Even death was wonderful.<br/> When it finally came, it would find him happy. He would not shudder away from it, as he saw <br/>Louise doing now at the sight of the ominous shadow.<br/><br/>

He smiled at his wife again, remembering the six years they had lived together. It had been a short<br/> married life, but—again the word suggested itself to him—a wonderful one. There had been only <br/>one quarrel of importance, in the second year, and after that they had got along perfectly. And<br/> then, two years ago, he had begun to take marak, and after that he couldn't have quarreled with <br/>anyone. It was a paragon among drugs, and it was one of the mysteries of his existence that<br/> anybody should object to his using it.<br/><br/>

Louise had tried to argue with him after she had found out, but he had turned every exchange of<br/> views into a peaceful discussion, which from his side, at least, was brimming over with good <br/>humor. He had even been good-humored when she tried to slip the antidote into his food. It was<br/> this attitude of his that had so often left her baffled and enraged, and he had a good chuckle out of<br/> that, too. Imagine a wife getting angry because her husband was too good-natured.<br/><br/>

But she was never going to get angry again. He would see to that. Not after tonight. A big change<br/> was going to take place in her life.<br/><br/>

She had picked up another book, and for the moment he pitied her. He knew that she wasn't<br/> interested in any books. She was merely restless, looking for something to do with herself, seeking<br/> some method of killing time before the shadows outside killed it for her for good and all. She<br/> couldn't understand his being so peaceful and contented, doing nothing at all.<br/><br/>

She threw the second book down and snarled—yes, that was the word, "You're such a fool, Jim!<br/> You sit there, smug and sure of yourself, your mind blank, just waiting—waiting for them to kill<br/> you and me. And you seem actually happy when I mention it."<br/><br/>

"I'm happy at anything and everything, dear."<br/><br/>

"At the thought of dying too?"<br/><br/>

"Living or dying—it doesn't make any difference. Whatever happens, I'm incapable of being<br/> unhappy."<br/><br/>

"If it weren't for the drug, we'd both live. You'd think of a way to kill them before they killed us.<br/><br/>"

"There is no way."<br/><br/>

"There must be. You just can't think of it while the drug has you in its grip."<br/><br/>

"The drug doesn't have you, dear." He asked without sarcasm, "Why don't you think of a way?"<br/><br/>

"Because I lack the training you have. Because I don't have the scientific knowledge, and all the<br/> equipment scattered around means nothing to me."<br/><br/>

"There's nothing to be done."<br/><br/>

Her fists clenched. "If you weren't under the influence of the drug—"<br/><br/>

"You know that it doesn't affect the ability to think. Tests have shown that."<br/><br/>

"Tests conducted by addicts themselves!"<br/><br/>

"The fact that they can conduct the tests should be proof enough that there's nothing wrong with<br/> their minds."<br/><br/>

"But there is!" she shouted. "I can see it in you. Oh, I know that you can still add and subtract, and<br/> you can draw lines under two words which mean the same thing, but that isn't really thinking.<br/> Real thinking means the ability to tackle real problems—hard problems that you can't handle<br/> merely with paper and pencil. It means having the incentive to use your brain for a long time at a<br/> stretch. And that's what the drug has ruined. It has taken away all your incentive."<br/><br/>

"I still go about my duties."<br/><br/>

"Not as well as you used to, and even at that, only because they've become a habit. Just as you talk<br/> to me, because I've become a habit. If you'd let me give you the antidote—"<br/><br/>

He chuckled at the absurdity of her suggestion. Once an addict had been cured, he could not<br/> become addicted again. The antidote acted to produce a permanent immunization against the<br/> effects of the drug. It was the realization of this fact that made addicts fight so hard against any<br/> attempt to cure them. And she thought that she could convince him by argument!<br/><br/>

He said, "You talk of not being able to think!"<br/><br/>

"I know," she replied hotly. "I'm the one who blunders. I'm the fool, for arguing with you, when I<br/> realize that it's impossible to convince a marak addict."<br/><br/>

"That's it," he nodded, and chuckled again. But that wasn't quite it. For he was also chuckling at<br/> his plan. She had thought him unable to tackle a real problem. Well, he would tackle one tonight.<br/> Then she would simply adopt his point of view, and she would no longer be unhappy. After she<br/> had accepted the solution he had provided, she would wonder how she could ever have opposed<br/> him.<br/><br/>

He fell into one of his dozes and hardly noticed her glaring at him. When he came out of it at last,<br/> it was to hear her say, "We have to stay alive as long as possible. For the sake of the lighthouse."<br/><br/>

"Of course, my dear. I don't dispute that at all."<br/><br/>

"And the longer we stay alive, the more chance there is that some ship will pick us up."<br/><br/>

"Oh, no, there's no chance at all," he asserted cheerfully. "You know that as well as I do. No use<br/> deceiving yourself, my love."<br/><br/>

That, he observed to himself, was the way of non-addicts. They couldn't look facts in the face.<br/> They had to cling to a blind and silly optimism which no facts justified.<br/><br/>

He knew that there was no hope. He was able to review the facts calmly, judiciously, to see the<br/> inevitability of their dying—and to take pleasure even in that.<br/><br/>

He reviewed them for her now. "Let us see, sweetheart, whether I've lost my ability to analyze a<br/> situation. We're here with our pretty little lighthouse in the middle of a group of asteroids between<br/> Mars and Earth. Ships have been wrecked here, and our task is to prevent further wrecks. The<br/> lighthouse sends out a standard high-frequency beam whose intensity and phase permit astrogators<br/> to estimate their distance and direction from us. Ordinarily, there's nothing for us to do. But on the<br/> rare occasions when the beam fails—"<br/><br/>

"That will be the end."<br/><br/>

"On those occasions," he continued, unruffled by her interruption, "I am supposed to leave my<br/> cosy little shelter, so thoughtfully equipped with all the comforts of Earth or Mars, and make<br/> repairs as rapidly as possible. Under the usual conditions, lighthousekeeping is a boring task. In<br/> fact, it has been known to drive people insane. That's why it's generally assigned to happily<br/> married couples like us, who are accustomed to living quietly, without excitement."<br/><br/>

"And that," she added bitterly, "is why even happily married couples are usually relieved after one<br/> year."<br/><br/>

"But, darling," he said, his tone cheerful, "you mustn't blame anyone. Who would have expected<br/> that a maverick meteor would come at us and displace us from our orbit? And who would have expected that the meteor would have<br/> collided first with the outer asteroids, and picked up a cargo<br/> of—those?"<br/><br/>

He gestured toward the window, where a shadow had momentarily paused. By the light that shone<br/> through, he could see that the creature was relatively harmless-looking. It had what appeared to be<br/> a round, humorous face whose unhumorous intentions would be revealed only at the moment of<br/> the kill. The seeming face was actually featureless, for it was not a face at all. It had neither eyes,<br/> nor nose, nor mouth. The effect of features was given by the odd blend of colors. Almost escaping<br/> notice because of their unusual position and their dull brown hue were the stomach fangs, in neat<br/> rows which could be extended and retracted like those of a snake.<br/><br/>

<hr>

He noticed that Louise had shuddered again, and said, in the manner of a man making<br/> conversation, "Interesting, aren't they? They're rock breathers, you know. They need very little<br/> oxygen, and they extract that from the silicates and other oxygen-containing compounds of the<br/> rock."<br/><br/>

"Don't talk about them."<br/><br/>

"All right, if you don't want me to. But about us—you see, my dear, no one expected us to be lost.<br/> And even if the Lighthouse Service has started to look for us, it'll take a long time to find us."<br/><br/>

"We have food, water, air. If not for those beasts, we'd last until a rescue ship appeared."<br/><br/>

"But even a rescue ship wouldn't be able to reach us unless we kept the beam going. So far, we've<br/> been lucky. It's really functioned remarkably well. But sooner or later it'll go out of order, and then<br/> I'll have to go out and fix it. You agree to that, don't you, Louise, dear?"<br/><br/>

She nodded. She said quietly, "The beam must be kept in order."<br/><br/>

"That's when the creatures will get me," he said, almost with satisfaction. "I may kill one or two of<br/> them, although the way I feel toward everything, I hate to kill anything at all. But you know,<br/> sweetheart, that there are more than a dozen of them altogether, and it's clumsy shooting in a<br/> spacesuit at beasts which move as swiftly as they do."<br/><br/>

"And if you don't succeed in fixing what's wrong, if they get you—" She broke down suddenly<br/> and began to cry.<br/><br/>

He looked at her with compassion, and smoothed her hair. And yet, under the influence of the drug,<br/> he enjoyed even her crying. It was, as he never tired of repeating to himself and to her a<br/> wonderful drug. Under its spell, a man—or a woman—could really enjoy life.<br/><br/>

Tonight she would begin to enjoy life along with him.<br/><br/>

Their chronometer functioned perfectly, and they still regulated their living habits by it, using<br/> Greenwich Earth time. At seven in the evening they sat down to a fine meal. Knowing that<br/> tomorrow they might die, Louise had decided that tonight they would eat and drink as well as they<br/> could, and she had selected a Christmas special. She had merely to pull a lever, and the food had<br/> slid into the oven, to be cooked at once by an intense beam of high-frequency radiation. Jim<br/> himself had chosen the wine and the brandy—one of the peculiarities of the marak was that it did<br/> not affect the actual enjoyment of alcoholic drinks in the slightest, and one of the<br/> sights of the Solar System was to see an addict who was also drunk.<br/><br/>

But it was a rare sight, for the marak itself created such a pervading sensation of well-being that it<br/> often acted as a cure for alcoholism. Once an alcoholic had experienced its effect, he had no need<br/> to get drunk to forget his troubles. He enjoyed his troubles instead, and drank the alcohol for its<br/> own sake, for its ability to provide a slightly different sensation, and not for its ability to release<br/> him from an unhappy world.<br/><br/>

So tonight Palmer drank moderately, taking just enough, as it seemed to him, to stimulate his<br/> brain. And he did what he now realized he should have done long ago. Unobserved, he placed a<br/> tablet of marak in his own wineglass and one in Louise's. The slight bitterness of taste would be<br/> hardly perceptible. And after that Louise would be an addict too.<br/><br/>

That was the way the marak worked. There was nothing mysterious about the craving. It was<br/> simply that once you had experienced how delightful it was, you wouldn't do without it.<br/><br/>

The tablet he had taken that morning was losing its effect, but he felt so pleased at what he was<br/> doing that he didn't mind even that. For the next half hour he would enjoy himself simply by<br/> looking at Louise, and thinking that now at last they would be united again, no longer kept apart<br/> by her silly ideas about doing something to save themselves. And then the drug would take effect,<br/> and they would feel themselves lifted to the stars together, never to come down to this substitute<br/> for Earth again until the beam failed, and they went out together to make the repairs, and the<br/> shadows closed in on them.<br/><br/>

He had made sure that Louise had her back to him when he dropped the tablet into her glass, and<br/> he saw that she suspected nothing. She drank her wine, he noticed, without even commenting on<br/> the taste. He felt a sudden impulse to kiss her, and, somewhat to her surprise, he did so. Then he<br/> sat down again and went on with the dinner.<br/><br/>

<img src="illus2.jpg"/><br/><br/>

<hr>

He waited.<br/><br/>

An hour later he knew that he had made her happy.<br/> She was laughing as she hadn't laughed for a long time. She laughed at the humorous things he said, at the flattering way he raised his glass to<br/> her, even at what she saw through the window. Sometimes it seemed to him that she was laughing<br/><br/> at nothing at all.<br/><br/>

He tried to think of how he had reacted the first time he had taken the drug. He hadn't been quite<br/> so aggressively cheerful, not quite so—hysterical. But then, the drug didn't have exactly the same<br/> effect on everyone. She wasn't as well balanced as he had been. The important thing was that she<br/> was happy.<br/><br/>

Curiously enough, he himself wasn't happy at all.<br/><br/>

It took about five seconds for the thought to become clear to him, five seconds in which he passed<br/> from dull amazement to an enraged and horrified comprehension. He sprang to his feet,<br/> overturning the table at which they still sat. And he saw that she wasn't surprised at all, that<br/> she still stared at him with a secret satisfaction.<br/><br/>

"You've cured me!" he cried. "You've fed me the antidote!"<br/><br/>

And he began to curse. He remembered the other time she had tried it, the time when he had been<br/> on the alert, and had easily detected the strange metallic taste of the stuff. He had spat it out, and<br/> under the influence of the drug from which she had hoped to save him, he had laughed at her.<br/><br/>

Now he was unable to laugh. He had been so intent on feeding the tablet to her that he had<br/> forgotten to guard himself, and he had been caught. He was normal now—her idea of being<br/> normal—and he would never again know the wonderful feeling the drug gave. He began to realize<br/> his situation on this horrible lonely asteroid. He cast a glance at the window and at what must be<br/> waiting outside, and it was his turn to shudder.<br/><br/>

He noticed that she was still smiling.<br/><br/>

He said bitterly, "You're the addict now and I'm cured."<br/><br/>

She stopped smiling and said quietly, "Jim, listen to me. You're wrong, completely wrong.<br/> I didn't give you the antidote, and you didn't<br/> give me the drug."<br/><br/>

"I put it in your wineglass myself."<br/><br/>

She shook her head. "That was a tablet I substituted for yours. It's an anti-virus dose from our<br/> medicine chest. You took one of the same things. That's why you feel so depressed. You're not<br/> under the influence of the drug any more."<br/><br/>

He took a deep breath. "But I'm not cured?"<br/><br/>

"No. I knew that I wouldn't be able to slip you the antidote. The taste is too strong. Later you'll be<br/> able to start taking the drug again. That is, if you want to, after experiencing for a time what it is<br/> to be normal. But not now. You have to keep your head clear. You have to think of something to<br/> save us."<br/><br/>

"But there's nothing to think of!" he shouted angrily. "I told you that the drug doesn't affect the<br/> intelligence!"<br/><br/>

"I still don't believe you. If you'd only exert yourself, use your mind—"<br/><br/>

He said savagely, "I'm not going to bother. Give me those marak tablets."<br/><br/>

She backed away from him. "I thought you might want them. I took no chances. I threw them<br/> out."<br/><br/>

"Out there?" A horrified and incredulous look was on his face. "You mean that I'm stuck here<br/> without them? Louise, you fool, there's no help for us! The other way, at least, we'd have died<br/> happy. But now—"<br/><br/>

He stared out the window. The shadows were there in full force. Not one now, but two, three—he<br/> counted half a dozen. It was almost as if they knew that the end had come.<br/><br/>

They had reason to be happy, he thought with despair. And perhaps— he shrank back from the<br/> thought, but it forced itself into his mind—perhaps, now that all happiness had gone, and<br/> wretchedness had taken its place, he might as well end everything. There would be no days to spend<br/> torturing himself in anticipation of a horrible death.<br/><br/>

Louise exclaimed suddenly, "Jim, look! They're frolicking!"<br/><br/>

He looked. The beasts certainly were gay. One of them leaped from the airless surface of the<br/> asteroid and sailed over its fellow. He had never seen them do that before. Usually they clung to<br/> the rocky surface. Another was spinning around oddly, as if it had lost its sense of balance.<br/><br/>

Louise said, "They've swallowed the tablets! Over a hundred doses—enough to drug every beast<br/> on the asteroid!"<br/><br/>

For a moment Palmer stared at the gamboling alien drug addicts. Then he put on his spacesuit and<br/> took his gun, and, without the slightest danger to himself, went out and shot them one by one. He<br/> noted, with a kind of grim envy, that they died happy.<br/><br/>
